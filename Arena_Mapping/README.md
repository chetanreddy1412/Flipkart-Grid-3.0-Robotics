- Run the Arena_Mapping.py script to start.
- The controls can be adjusted to decide the HSV range
- Adjusting just the saturation value (us_mask1) can detect the arena (because of its black and white color)
- However, the controls allow two masks to be used if required
- Once the Arena is correctly recognised, **press 'S'** to lock the arena
- The following frame will just focus on the arena.

- Mapping real-time motion on the arena to coordinates yet to be done.
