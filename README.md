Video of the implementation:
- Waypoints are generated by the centralised controller so that the robot can go to its destination. The task in the video is to go the top middle region and come back
- The images from the camera at the top are processed to locate the robot. We have used hsv filtering and CSRT object tracking using OpenCV.
- The velocity commands are sent to the robot using a PID control.
